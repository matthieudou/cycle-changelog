      <p>It was already possible to sync Cycle and Salesforce via API but now you can install a native Salesforce integration. There are two use cases:</p>
      <p>First, customer-facing teams can send feedback straight from Salesforce to the product team. You can do so from any Lead, Contact, or Account page.</p>
      <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/do44szjts/image/upload/v1722538804/ddac5a3b-0881-4bdd-9b00-a32a2c6e791c.png">
      <p>Second, you can set up an automation to automatically send all messages that match specific criteria using Cycle‚Äôs API.</p>
      <p>In both cases, you'll receive updates on Salesforce as soon as the customer requests status changes in Cycle, helping you close the feedback loop every time you ship something.</p>

      <p>For those receiving feedback in various languages, you can now define AI's preferred language for AI-generated titles. It helps keep the workspace consistent.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, LLMs are down. But your feedback autopilot still needs to run. So we now automatically switch from one model to the other in case there's an error. That way, your AI requests get done in a consistent way.</p>

    htmlContent: `
      <p>We‚Äôve refined the logic for linking features to insights in autopilot mode. We‚Äôre now way stricter, meaning we match only when we‚Äôre sure of our recommendations.</p>
      <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/do44szjts/image/upload/v1721390298/54d4116f-5743-4e7f-a87c-093dddcae808.png">
      <p>Here‚Äôs a recap of our improved semantic match logic:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>We link the closest feature to a quote if there‚Äôs a clear match.</li>
      <li>If no link is found, we check among existing quotes that are already linked for a close match. If there‚Äôs a clear winner, we link the quote to that feature</li>
      <li>If still unmatched, we generate a potential new feature name with AI and compare it semantically with existing features. If there is a clear winner, we link that feature.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If no matches are found after these steps, we'll suggest the best potential matches in the recommendations.</p>
