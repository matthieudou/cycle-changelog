# Cycle Team Changelog App


This project is a technical test for the Cycle team. The goal is to implement a small changelog application that allows users to view and add public releases.

Hosted version can be found on https://cycle-changelog.vercel.app/

## Features

- Display a list of public releases
- Add a new public release to the changelog

## Instructions

Follow the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/wpeThM903HvpTyAZYQmoH8/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=rjzWM95cGXlu4SZx-0) to implement the UI.

## API

This app uses the Cycle GraphQL API to manage changelogs and releases.

You can use the GraphQL playground to test queries and mutations: [Cycle API Playground](https://api.dogfood.cycle.app/playground)
